# Multilingual-Video-Synopsys-generator
The Multilingual Video Synopsis Generator entails downloading the most recent video, utilising Google Speech Recognition to transcribe the audio material, tokenization, sentiment analysis, and translation into Arabic and French as preparation steps. Next, it uses pre-trained transformer models (BART and MBART) to generate summaries in English, Arabic, and French. The quality of these summaries is then assessed using ROUGE ratings. All in all, the project automates the summary process, allowing users to effectively extract important information from multilingual videos.
